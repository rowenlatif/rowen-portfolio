                          Starborne is a two-player, card-based battle game designed 
                          around a celestial theme, blending whimsical sci-fi aesthetics 
                          with strategic gameplay. Created collaboratively, the game invites 
                          players to draw from 30 unique cards featuring celestial entities 
                          such as planets, moons, constellations, and more and use them to 
                          attack, defend, and outmaneuver their opponent in a bid to reduce 
                          their Starlife to zero.

                        <p>
                          We set out to design a physical game that was visually engaging, 
                          strategically fun, and thematically cohesive, without relying on digital interfaces. 
                          Our biggest challenge was crafting a rule system that felt intuitive and smooth while 
                          accounting for physical constraints like card size, game balance, and the complexity 
                          of interactions.
                        </p>

                        <p class="ov-title">THE SOLUTION</p>
                        <p>
                          We developed an original 2-player card game from the ground up, including rules, 
                          game modes, card designs, and play mechanics. Each card was hand-illustrated and 
                          built with stats like health, attack power, and unique abilities. We prototyped 
                          and refined through sketching, digital design (Procreate), and multiple test prints 
                          using 80lb cardstock. The final set included 30 playable cards, a board, a box, and 
                          optional visual health counters ("Starlives"). Our design process emphasized visual 
                          storytelling and collaborative iteration.

                        <p>
                          Starborne taught me how to manage a full creative production pipeline, from concept to 
                          prototyping to presentation. I learned how to design within a group while balancing t
                          hematic unity with individual artistic expression. It also reinforced the value of 
                          playtesting and iteration, as we adapted rules and mechanics based on real feedback.
