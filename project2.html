                        <p>The KTP Pledge App is a mobile prototype designed to streamline the pledge experience for Kappa Theta Pi, a professional tech fraternity. Built with a retro-tech aesthetic, the app helps pledges stay organized by centralizing tasks, events, and communication in one place. Features like secure login, automated reminders, a social directory, and a gamified leaderboard make the process more intuitive, engaging, and easy to manage.

                        <p>Kappa Theta Pi (KTP), a professional tech fraternity I’m a part of, needed a more 
                            efficient way to help pledges stay on top of their tasks, deadlines, and events. 
                            The old system was pieced together with spreadsheets, emails, and word-of-mouth 
                            reminders; it was confusing for new members and hard to manage for Pledge Masters. 
                            It was clear the process needed a digital upgrade that could centralize everything 
                            while still feeling approachable and fun.
                        </p>
                      </div>
                      <div class="purpose-item">
                        <p class="ov-title">THE SOLUTION</p>
                        <p>I designed a mobile app prototype for KTP pledges, using a retro-tech theme. The app includes 
                            a secure login system tied to university 
                            emails. Once inside, 
                            users get a personalized dashboard that shows their progress, upcoming events, and key 
                            requirements at a glance.

                            I also designed features like a customizable profile, a task tracker to sort and prioritize 
                            checklist items, and a notification system that sends automatic reminders. To keep things 
                            fun, I added a leaderboard to gamify task completion. There's also a calendar for events 
                            and a directory where pledges can track who they've met in the fraternity. I worked 
                            closely with KTP leadership and used an iterative design process to make sure the features 
                            actually support pledges and simplify their experience.

                        <p>Working on this app gave me experience designing for a very specific, real-world user base. 
                            I learned a lot about balancing utility with personality, and how to design features that 
                            feel genuinely helpful without overwhelming the user. It was also a great opportunity to 
                            practice research-driven design, as I worked closely with PMs to understand what pledges 
                            actually need during the process. The result was a thoughtful, scalable system that could 
                            really improve the pledge experience from day one.
