                          This emotionally-driven visual novel follows Theo as he navigates the lingering effects 
                          of a past relationship. Players guide his choices after he stumbles upon a powerful 
                          reminder of what once was, with each decision shaping his emotional journey and 
                          determining one of two possible endings. The project explores themes of guilt, memory, 
                          and personal growth through a branching narrative and immersive visual storytelling.

                        <p>I wanted to build a narrative game that didn’t just tell a story, but invited players 
                          to feel it, especially the emotional complexity of loss and healing. The challenge was 
                          creating a dialogue system where every choice felt organic and impactful, without making 
                          the structure feel rigid or overly game-like.
                        </p>
                      </div>
                      <div class="purpose-item">
                        <p class="ov-title">THE SOLUTION</p>
                        <p>I developed a branching dialogue engine using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where player choices 
                          influence not only the narrative flow but also Theo’s internal emotional landscape. I created 
                          all art assets—character sprites, animations, backgrounds, and UI—by hand using Procreate and 
                          Photoshop. I used color theory, lighting shifts, and scene composition to subtly communicate 
                          Theo’s emotional state and guide player empathy. The UI was designed to be clean and emotionally 
                          immersive, helping the player focus on the story.

                        <p>This project deepened my understanding of interactive narrative design and how to use visual 
                          cues to enhance emotional storytelling. I also learned how to structure nonlinear dialogue and 
                          manage branching paths in a way that feels natural to the player. It reinforced how even small 
                          design decisions, like a shift in color or lighting, can carry emotional weight in an interactive 
                          experience.
