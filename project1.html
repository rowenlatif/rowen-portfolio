                        <p>A concept for an interactive fashion game designed to
                          test creativity under pressure, the Doll Dress-Up
                          Game challenges players to assemble the perfect
                          outfit based on a randomly assigned fashion theme, all
                          within a strict time limit. This project was developed
                          as a personal exploration into interactive game design
                          and digital fashion with an emphasis on intuitive UI,
                          responsive interactions, and interesting aesthetics.

                        <p>This was a personal project where I wanted to explore interactive game design through 
                          the lens of digital fashion. I loved early Internet dress-up games growing up, and I 
                          wanted to reimagine that format with a modern twist: more responsive, more intuitive, 
                          and more engaging. The challenge was designing something that felt fun and expressive, 
                          while still being accessible and easy to pick up—especially under the added pressure 
                          of a countdown timer.
                        </p>

                      <div class="purpose-item">
                        <p class="ov-title">THE SOLUTION</p>
                        <p>I created a timed fashion game where players build an outfit based on a random prompt 
                          like “Office Siren” or “Night Out,” using a tap-to-toggle and drag-to-remove interface. 
                          I coded the game in Processing, handling the game logic, event systems, and timer 
                          functionality, and drew all the assets myself in Procreate. I focused on keeping the 
                          interactions fluid and intuitive—things like immediate visual feedback, clear UI hierarchy, 
                          and a “Time’s Up” popup to keep the pace snappy. The themes are randomized from a curated 
                          list to encourage replayability and creativity each time you play.
                        </p>

                        <p>This project helped me dive deeper into game design and prototyping, especially with real-time 
                          feedback and state management. I also got to blend two of my favorite things, fashion illustration 
                          and interaction design. It taught me how important it is to design with both playfulness and structure 
                          in mind, especially when working with constraints like time limits. Plus, building everything from 
                          scratch (code and visuals) gave me a better appreciation for how small design decisions shape the 
                          entire user experience.
